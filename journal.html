<h1>My Journal</h1>
<p>Journal Entry 1</p>
<p>So far in CS1, I have learned how to add images to a div and link things onto the div. I am currently working on my website, which is designed to look like a phone, with the apps being links to things. I am excited by the idea of publishing this and am a bit frustrated by the formatting not working exactly how I wanted it to. My goal for the next week or two is to finish the website and push it through Terminal onto my website.</p>
<p>Journal Entry 2</p>
<p>In the past week I have done two main things. The first was pushing my website online using terminal, so now it can be accessed by anyone. The next thing I did was fix a lot of formatting issues that ranged from the text inside the app links to the background of this journal. Some of the changes I made were easy and just took some time because I had to repeat them, and some I did not know how to do and had to ask for help. I am very happy with what I have made so far, and can't wait to make more projects to add to my projects page/app.</p>
<p>Journal Entry 3</p>
<p>Recently, I made a css animation with fellow class mate Theo that involves a ball bouncing and the time synced up on his computer so it looked like the ball passed through screens. I think it is really cool and I feel very proud of my accomplishments in class so far. I am a bit frustrated with making javascript work because even though we have not learned about it in class, I have tried to figure it out on my own. Since it was to no avail, I am excited for the lesson on JS, so I can begin my next project.</p>
<p>Journal Entry 4</p>
<p>As I am writing this, I am about to push my first javascript project onto the internet. This project spawns pictures of Gunna of random size into random positions on the screen. A function is command that is used while coding, each language has a set amount but by coding one creates more. A function can run by telling it to run and setting a time for it to run or making it happen on click. Some terms I have learned in javascript so far are "variable", "function", and "child".</p>
<p>Journal Entry 5</p>
<p>I finished making a workable clock on my phone. It was an interesting process. First I found the code for how to make the clock work. Then I spent a lot of time positioning it right. Then I used photoshop to edit the phone image so that the still clock was not there. Then I debugged the clock so it would adjust when the time changed, say "10:07" instead of "10:7", not be in military time, and not repeat. Now, all these problems are fixed, and the clock works perfectly!</p>
<p>Journal Entry 6</p>
<p>I added my two most recent projects: a birthday present for Nick and a Hanukkah project. I also linked my how it works slides. I am enjoying all the progress I have made so far on my website.</p>
<p>Journal Entry 7</p>
<p>After a long hiatus from the journal of my computer science works, I am now back. I have solved Project Euler's problem 1 which is under project 7. The problem is finding the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000. I did this by adding all the numbers that are 0 modulo 3 and and 0 modulo 5 to a variable with a starting value of 0. I then subtracted all the numbers that are 0 modulo 15 as I added them twice under each condition. This got me the correct answer of 233168! I am excited to continue doing Euler's problems!</p>
<p>Journal Entry 8</p>
<p>I am currently working on a project about facial recogniton although I must say I am a bit put off by it. It is somewhat annoying and I think I might have to try something else. Also Russia attacked Ukraine! Outrageous, dude!</p>
<p>Journal Entry 9</p>
<p>I completed all the challenges that were assigned in class and posted them under project 9. The first div when clicked disappears, the second div continuosly shuffles through colors and when clicked spawns 100 other divs. The final div changes the background color when clicked and when clicked an odd number of times is one color, and another for an even number of times. Finally, there is a link that takes you back to the index.</p>
<p>Journal Entry 10</p>
<p>I continued to work on Euler problems doing 2-4 and getting them all correct. I decided to solve them in python because I think it is easier to use than javascript, especially in this application. I put my solutions to it in project 10 and am eager to do more!</p>
