<h1>My Journal</h1>
<p>Journal Entry 1</p>
<p>So far in CS1, I have learned how to add images to a div and link things onto the div. I am currently working on my website, which is designed to look like a phone, with the apps being links to things. I am excited by the idea of publishing this and am a bit frustrated by the formatting not working exactly how I wanted it to. My goal for the next week or two is to finish the website and push it through Terminal onto my website.</p>
<p>Journal Entry 2</p>
<p>In the past week I have done two main things. The first was pushing my website online using terminal, so now it can be accessed by anyone. The next thing I did was fix a lot of formatting issues that ranged from the text inside the app links to the background of this journal. Some of the changes I made were easy and just took some time because I had to repeat them, and some I did not know how to do and had to ask for help. I am very happy with what I have made so far, and can't wait to make more projects to add to my projects page/app.</p>
<p>Journal Entry 3</p>
<p>Recently, I made a css animation with fellow class mate Theo that involves a ball bouncing and the time synced up on his computer so it looked like the ball passed through screens. I think it is really cool and I feel very proud of my accomplishments in class so far. I am a bit frustrated with making javascript work because even though we have not learned about it in class, I have tried to figure it out on my own. Since it was to no avail, I am excited for the lesson on JS, so I can begin my next project.</p>
<p>Journal Entry 4</p>
<p>As I am writing this, I am about to push my first javascript project onto the internet. This project spawns pictures of Gunna of random size into random positions on the screen. A function is command that is used while coding, each language has a set amount but by coding one creates more. A function can run by telling it to run and setting a time for it to run or making it happen on click. Some terms I have learned in javascript so far are "variable", "function", and "child".</p>
<p>Journal Entry 5</p>
<p>I finished making a workable clock on my phone. It was an interesting process. First I found the code for how to make the clock work. Then I spent a lot of time positioning it right. Then I used photoshop to edit the phone image so that the still clock was not there. Then I debugged the clock so it would adjust when the time changed, say "10:07" instead of "10:7", not be in military time, and not repeat. Now, all these problems are fixed, and the clock works perfectly!</p>
<p>Journal Entry 6</p>
<p>I added my two most recent projects: a birthday present for Nick and a Hanukkah project. I also linked my how it works slides. I am enjoying all the progress I have made so far on my website.</p>
