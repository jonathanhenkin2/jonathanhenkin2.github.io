<p>Journal Entry 1</p>
<p>So far in CS1, I have learned how to add images to a div and link things onto the div. I am currently working on my website, which is designed to look like a phone, with the apps being links to things. I am excited by the idea of publishing this and am a bit frustrated by the formatting not working exactly how I wanted it to. My goal for the next week or two is to finish the website and push it through Terminal onto my website.</p>
